# HR METRICS EXPLAIN IN DETAILS WITH EXAMPLES
HR metrics are numbers that help us understand how well a company's HR department is doing. They give us information about things like how good the employees are at their jobs, how happy they are, and how well the HR programs and activities are working. By looking at these numbers, the HR team can make better decisions, find ways to make things even better, and make sure their plans match the company's goals.

## HR Performance Metrics
1. Revenue per FTE (Full-Time Equivalent): Revenue per FTE is a metric that measures the amount of revenue generated by the organization per full-time equivalent employee. It helps assess the productivity and efficiency of the workforce in generating revenue.     
=Total Revenue/ No. of Full Time Equivalent Employees   

Example: Let's say a company generated a total revenue of $10 million in a given year. During the same period, they had 200 full-time equivalent employees.   

Revenue per FTE = $10000000/200 = $50000    

In this example, the revenue per FTE is $50,000 meaning that on average, each full-time equivalent employee contributed $50,000 to the company's revenue.

2. Profit per Employee: Profit per employee is a metric that measures the profitability of an organization per employee. It helps evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the workforce in generating profits for the company.         
=Net Profit/ No. of Employees   

Example: Let's consider a company that generated a net profit of $5 million in a given year. During the same period, they had 250 employees.

Profit per Employee = $5000000/250 = $20000

3. Labor Cost per Employee: Labor Cost per Employee is a metric that measures the average cost incurred by an organization for each employee. It includes all the expenses related to employee compensation, such as wages, salaries, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, and any other costs directly associated with employing individuals.     
=Total Labor Costs/ No. of Employees    

Example: Let's consider a company that incurred $1000000 in labor costs (including salaries, benefits, taxes, etc.) during a specific period. The company had 100 employees during that time. 

Labor Cost per Employee = $1000000/100 = $10000     
__________________________________________________________________

4. Labor Cost Percentage of Revenue: Labor Cost Percentage of Revenue is a metric that measures the proportion of an organization's total revenue that is allocated to labor costs. It helps assess the impact of labor expenses on the overall financial performance of the company.   
=(Total Labor Costs/ Total Revenue) x100

Example: Let's assume a company has total labor costs of $500000 and generates a total revenue of $2000000 in a specific period.    

Labor Cost Percentage of Revenue = $500000/$2000000 x100 = 25%

5. Absence Rate per Department: Absence Rate per Department is a metric that measures the average rate of employee absences within each department of an organization. It helps evaluate the frequency and extent of employee absences in different areas of the company.   
=(No. of Absence Hrs in a Dept/ Total Available Work Hrs in a Dept) x100    

Example: Let's consider a company with three departments: Department A,Department B, and Department C. In a specific period, Department A had 100 absence hours, Department B had 200 absence hours, and Department C had 150 absence hours. The total available work hours in Department A were 5000, in Department B were 7000, and in Department C were 6500.    

Absence Rate for Department A = 100/ 5000 × 100 = 2%    
Absence Rate for Department B = 200/ 7000 × 100 = 2.86%     
Absence Rate for Department C = 150/ 6500 × 100 = 2.31%     
__________________________________________________________________

6. Overtime Expense per Period: Overtime Expense per Period is a metric that measures the total cost incurred by an organization for overtime hours worked by employees during a specific period. It helps assess the financial impact of overtime work and the efficiency of workforce planning.   
=Total Overtime Hours Worked x Overtime Hourly Rate     

Example: Let's assume a company had a total of 500 overtime hours worked during a specific period, and the overtime hourly rate is $25.     

Overtime Expense per Period = 500 hrs × $25 = $12500

7. Training Expense per Employee: Training Expense per Employee is a metric that measures the average cost incurred by an organization to provide training and development opportunities to each employee. It includes all expenses related to training programs, workshops, seminars, e-learning courses, materials, trainers' fees, and any other costs directly associated with employee learning and development.   
=Total Training Expenses/ No. of Employees  

Example: Let's assume a company spent $100000 on various training programs, workshops, and development initiatives in a specific period. During that time, the company had 200 employees.   

Training Expense per Employee = $100000/200 = $500

8. Turnover Rate: Turnover Rate is a metric that measures the rate at which employees leave an organization over a specific period of time. It indicates the proportion of employees who exit the company, voluntarily or involuntarily, in relation to the total workforce during that period.     
=(No. of Employees who Left/ Average No. of Employees)  x100    

Example: Let's say a company had 50 employees at the beginning of the year and during that year, 10 employees left the company.     

Turnover Rate = 10/ 50 × 100 = 20%      
__________________________________________________________________

9. Turnover Rate per Department: Turnover Rate per Department is a metric that measures the rate at which employees leave specific departments within an organization over a specific period of time. It helps assess the turnover or attrition rate within different areas or teams of the company.    
=(No. of Employees who Left a Dept/ Average No. of Employees in the Dept)   x100   

Example: Let's consider a company with three departments: Department A, Department B, and Department C. During a specific period, Department A had 20 employees, Department B had 30 employees, and Department C had 50 employees. In that period, Department A had 3 employees who left, Department B had 5 employees who left, and Department C had 8 employees who left.     

Turnover Rate for Department A = 3/20 × 100 = 15%   
Turnover Rate for Department B = 5/30 × 100 = 16.67%    
Turnover Rate for Department C = 8/50 × 100 = 16%

10. Cost of Absenteeism: Cost of Absenteeism is a metric that measures the financial impact of employee absences on an organization. It quantifies the direct and indirect costs incurred by the company due to employee absences, including both planned and unplanned time off.   
=(Total Absenteeism Hours x Hourly Wage) + Additional Cost Incurred

Additional Costs Incurred can include expenses related to hiring temporary staff, overtime payments to cover workload, decreased productivity, impact on customer service, training replacement employees, or any other costs directly associated with managing and addressing employee absences.   

Example: Let's assume a company has a total of 1000 absenteeism hours in a specific period. The average hourly wage of employees is $25. Additionally, the company incurred additional costs of $5000 due to absenteeism-related factors such as overtime payments and temporary staffing.  

Cost of Absenteeism = (1000 hrs × $25) + $5000 = $30000
__________________________________________________________________

11. Cost of Turnover: Cost of Turnover is a metric that measures the financial impact of employee turnover on an organization. It quantifies the direct and indirect costs incurred as a result of employees leaving the company and the subsequent recruitment and onboarding of new employees.    
=Separation Costs + Replacement Cost + Training Costs + Productivity Costs  

The components of the formula are as follows:
- Separation Costs: Expenses related to employee separation, including exit interviews, administrative tasks, and any other costs associated with the departure process.
- Replacement Costs: Expenses incurred in the recruitment and hiring process, such as job advertising, agency fees, pre-employment assessments, and background checks.
- Training Costs: Expenses associated with training and onboarding new employees, including orientation programs, job-specific training, and mentorship.
- Productivity Costs: The decrease in productivity during the transition period as new employees ramp up to full productivity levels, including the time spent by managers and colleagues in assisting and mentoring new hires.     

Example: Let's consider a company that experiences turnover of 10 employees in a specific period. The separation costs per employee are $2000, replacement costs are $5000 per employee, training costs per employee are $3000, and productivity costs per employee are estimated to be $10000.     

Cost of Turnover = (10 × $2000) + (10 × $5000) + (10 × $3000) + (10 × $10000) = $190000

12. HR to Employee Ratio: HR to Employee Ratio is a metric that measures the number of HR staff members relative to the total number of employees in an organization. It indicates the HR department's capacity and workload in managing and supporting the organization's workforce.   
=No. of HR Staff/ No. of Employees  

Example: Let's assume a company has 5 HR staff members and a total of 200 employees.
HR to Employee Ratio = 5/ 200 = 0.025   
__________________________________________________________________

13. HR Cost to Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): HR Cost to FTE is a metric that measures the average cost incurred by an organization for HR-related expenses per Full-Time Equivalent employee. It helps assess the cost efficiency of the HR function in relation to the size of the workforce.    
=Total HR Costs/ Total FTE Employees    

Example: Let's assume a company has total HR costs of $500000 and employs 100 Full-Time Equivalent employees.   

HR Cost to FTE = $500000/ 100 = $5000   
__________________________________________________________________

14. Promotion Rate: Promotion Rate is a metric that measures the proportion or percentage of employees who are promoted within a specific period. It indicates the rate at which employees advance to higher positions or take on increased responsibilities within the organization.   
=(No. of Employees Promoted / Total No. of Employees) x100  

Example: Let's consider a company that has 500 employees and promotes 50 employees to higher positions or roles within a given year.    

Promotion Rate = 50/500 × 100 = 10%
